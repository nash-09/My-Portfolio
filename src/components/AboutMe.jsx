        <p className='mb-3'>Hello! I'm Niranjan Barupal, a passionate Frontend Web Developer who loves turning ideas into interactive and user-friendly websites. My journey began with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm currently expanding my skills by learning React.js and Tailwind CSS to build faster, modern, and fully responsive web applications.</p>

<p className='mb-3'>I enjoy crafting clean layouts, smooth animations, and intuitive interfaces that make browsing an enjoyable experience. I'm curious by nature, eager to learn, and constantly pushing myself to improve both my skills and creativity.</p>

<p>When I'm not working on projects, you'll often find me experimenting with design ideas, exploring new technologies, or working on personal projects that challenge my problem-solving abilities. My goal is simple â€” to create digital experiences that are functional, visually appealing, and unforgettable.</p>
